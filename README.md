In this for the frontend part tkinter is used and for the backend part sqlite3 is used. I have not used any existing database but made a one of my own. The person using the code can use any database simply by changing the name of the db file in the backend code. Note : Remember to look for the columns and  rows according to the code so you don't face any problems.


Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is 
included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.


SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.

In this code it is your decision to start with frontend part or the backend part first. But I strongly recommend to make the frontend first.  The output of the frontend is shown in the frontend_output.jpg
